The production of a Higgs boson in association with an EW gauge boson can be considered one of the canonical LHC processes sensitive to SMEFT effects. Operators which modify the Higgs coupling to these gauge bosons, introducing momentum dependent interactions modify the production rate, especially enhancing it in the high energy regime. The associate production process can naturally access this region of phase space since the Higgs is produced recoiling against the associated vector, meaning that the $p_T$ of the Higgs or vector boson are a faithful proxy for the energy flowing through the EFT vertex. Of the many dimension-6 operators that can contribute to this process, we consider 
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{O}_{\sss HW} &= 
    \frac{ig}{\Lambda^2} \big[D_\mu \phi^\dag T_{2k} D_\nu \phi\big] 
    W^{k,\mu \nu},
\end{align}
an operator from the so called strongly interacting light Higgs (SILH) basis~\cite{Giudice:2007fh,Contino:2013kra}. Here, $T_{2k}$ refers to the generators of $SU(2)_L$ normalised such that $\{T_{2i},T_{2j}\}=\delta_{ij}/2$ and the covariant derivative, $D_\mu$, for the Higgs field is defined as
\begin{align}
    D_\mu\phi &= \partial_\mu \phi -  i g T_{2k} W_\mu^k \phi - \frac12 i g' B_\mu \phi,
\end{align}
with $g$ and $g^\prime$ the weak and hypercharge gauge couplings respectively.
